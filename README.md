# M42Installer
An installer script for Momentum

This is a project to provide simple, canned installers for typical situations.  
These were created for personal use and may not be maintained.  
Use at your own discression. 
 
 The naming convention is pretty straight forward.  IE: **Singlenode_4.2.28-MTA-ONLY** is kina obvious.
 The general steps are:
 - Build a server/VM/Instance
 - Save this script as something like "installer.sh"
 - Execute as "sh installer.sh"
 - follow all the prompts.
 
 Any specific instructions are buried in the script and are typically exposed as part of the Bash script.
 There is very little (if any) field validation so be precise in your answers.
 
 **Secure_HTTP_nginx** can apply to any of the V4 builds and can be applied after the instal is complete.  It is just a fast way to make all the changes needed to secure nginx.
